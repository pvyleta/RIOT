@brief       Support for the Raytac MDBT50Q-DB (nRF52840)

The Raytac MDBT50Q-DB is a cheaper alternative to the official DK from Nordic
semiconductor, with the same pinout for LEDs and Buttons, featuring power via
mini-USB and ARM SWD connector.

This board definition is ported from the original definition for nRF52840DK.

### RESET pin configuration

On many (all?) nrf52840dk boards, the reset pin is not configured out-of-the box.
This means, that simply nothing happens if the RESET pin is pressed. To change
this, RIOT provides a little tool in `dist/tools/nrf52_resetpin_cfg`.

Simply compile, flash, and run that tool on your board, and the reset pin should
work for the time being.
