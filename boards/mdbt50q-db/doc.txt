@brief       Support for the Raytac MDBT50Q-DB (nRF52840)

The Raytac MDBT50Q-DB is a cheaper and stripped-down alternative to the
official DK from Nordic Semiconductor, with the same pinout for LEDs and
Buttons, featuring power via mini-USB and ARM SWD connector.

This board definition is ported from the original definition for nRF52840DK.
