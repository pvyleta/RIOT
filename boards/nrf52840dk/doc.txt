### RESET pin configuration

On many (all?) nrf52840dk boards, the reset pin is not configured out-of-the box.
This means, that simply nothing happens if the RESET pin is pressed. To change
this, RIOT provides a little tool in `dist/tools/nrf52_resetpin_cfg`.

Simply compile, flash, and run that tool on your board, and the reset pin should
work for the time being.

Note: This definition is perfectly useable for the Raytac MDBT50Q-DB development
board as well, as it features the same pin-out for LEDs, buttons and UART.
